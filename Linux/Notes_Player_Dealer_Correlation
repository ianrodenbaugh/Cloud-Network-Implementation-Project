To summurize the findings we have come to the conclusion the major losses suffered by the casino is due to malisious actors. The reason being aspects, first the losses occur at the same times of day when we suffer losses those being 5:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 8:00 PM, and 11:00 pm. Secondly every time we suffer a loss there has been a roulette dealer and player that have shown up every time meaning they are coordinating the losses. The dealer is Billy Jones and the player is Mylie Schmidt. Do the the fact that they happen at the same time every time and with the same dealer and player we conclude there is a crime happening
